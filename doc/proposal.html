<h1 align="center">Unicode Friendly Encoding Conversions for the Standard Library (R2)</h1>

<p  style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%;">Proposes character encoding conversion 
and related functions to ease interoperability between  
strings and other sequences of character types <code>char</code>, <code>char16_t</code>, 
<code>char32_t</code>, and <code>wchar_t</code>. Support for Unicode 
Transformation Form (UTF) and wide character encodings is built-in, while narrow 
character encodings are supported via traditional codecvt facets. Pure addition to the standard library. 
No changes to the 
core language or existing standard library components. Breaks no existing code 
or ABI. <a href="#Proposed-wording">Proposed wording</a> 
provided. Specified in accordance with ISO/IEC 10646 and the Unicode Standard. Has been implemented. Suitable for 
either a library TS or the standard itself.</p>



<p  style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%;">
<a href="#Major-interface-revision">Major interface revision</a>: R1 adds important functionality 
yet markedly reduces interface size. </p>



<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>



<p>C++ types <code>char</code>, <code>char16_t</code>, 
and
<code>char32_t</code> support character and string literals encoded in Unicode 
Transformation Forms UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 respectively. Additional narrow 
character encodings are supported by the standard library&#39;s codecvt facets 
via&nbsp;conversion to a wide character encoding.</p>



<p>Users may 
need to use multiple encodings in the same 
application, or even the same function. Yet neither the language nor the 
standard library provides a convenient C++ way to  convert between these encodings, 
let alone a way to do that securely. 
There is no equivalent to the ease with which the <code>std::to_string</code> 
family of functions can convert an arithmetic value to a string.</p>



<p>This proposal 
markedly eases the problems encountered by users due to the lack of convenient encoding conversion in the standard library. 
Knowledge of UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and the implementation defined <code>wchar_t</code> 
wide encoding is built-in to make the interface Unicode friendly. The interface meets the 
error handling requirements of the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 standards, and 
meets the error handling needs 
requested by Unicode experts.</p>



<h3>Example</h3>



  <p><b>Problem: </b>Convert a string <code>s</code> to UTF-16 in a way that converts the string types 
  and encodings, and handles errors according to the best practices documented in 
  the ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode standards.</p>
  <p><b>Using the proposal:</b></p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">LEWG/Toronto: Show the input and 
  output. Show the from and to types.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>
  <code>
  to_string&lt;utf16&gt;(s);</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p dir="ltr">Where <code>s</code> can be anything convertible to <code>
  std::basic_string_view&lt;<i>char/char16_t/char32_t/wchar_t</i>&gt;</code> encoded 
  in the associated UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, or wide character encoding. If <code>
  s</code> has a value type of <code>char</code>, but is not UTF-8 encoded, a 
  second argument supplies a <code>std::codecvt</code> derived facet that 
  converts to an internal type such as <code>wchar_t</code> or <code>char32_t</code> 
  and its associated encoding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;<code>to_string&lt;utf16&gt;(s, ccvt_facet);</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Without the proposal, using only the standard library:</b> This might not 
be too difficult using a third-party library, but is surprisingly difficult 
using only the standard library. Unless the developer has enough Unicode 
experience to focus on error detection and to test against an existing 
 
test data set, a roll-your-own solution would probably be very time 
consuming and 
error-prone.</p>



<p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">LEWG/Toronto: Show the existing code 
necessary to do this conversion.</span></p>

<h2>Prior proposal</h2>



<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3398.html">
N3398</a>, <i>String Interoperation Library</i>, proposed a complete overhaul of 
the standard library&#39;s mechanisms for character encoding conversion. The 
proposal was discussed at the Portland meeting in 2012. Some aspects of the 
proposal drew strong support, such as improving Unicode string interoperability. 
Other aspects drew strong opposition, such as new low level functionality to 
replace <code>std::codecvt</code>. Clearly participants did not want N3398 - 
they wanted a different proposal, less overreaching and more focused on Unicode 
encoding conversions. Bill Plauger summed it up when he said something like 
&quot;Don&#39;t reinvent <code>codecvt</code>. That said, we should pick  a 
winner &mdash; Unicode.&quot;</p>



<p>This P0353 proposal is completely new and not a revision of N3398.</p>



<h2>Revision history</h2>



<p><b>R1 - Pre-Issaquah mailing</b></p>



<ul>
  <li><p><a name="Major-interface-revision">Major interface revision</a>: 
  Discussion in Oulu and experimental use of the R0 interface exposed serious issues:</p>



    <ul>
      <li>Users who need UTF-based encoding conversion also often need 
      codecvt-based encoding 
      conversion and visa versa. Yet R0 did not provided codecvt-based 
      conversion.</li>
      <li>The R0 interface had 18 signatures spread over three levels of 
      functionality, and that was very confusing. Adding codecvt-based 
      conversion would have doubled the number of signatures further increasing 
      user confusion.</li>
    </ul>



<p>The R1 interface provides both UTF-based and codecvt-based encoding 
conversion, yet consists of only two levels of functionality and two conversions functions; a <code>recode</code> algorithm 
with a single signature and a <code>to_string</code> convenience function with 
four overloads.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
  <li>Added <a href="#uni.utf-query">UTF encoding query</a> 
  functions.</li>
  <li>Added <i><a href="#Requirements">Requirements</a></i> section.</li>
  <li>
  Assume the C++ WP will be changed to specify ISO/IEC 10646:2014, 
  and so that will be the base document for references.</li>
  <li>
  Lots of general refinement of the proposed wording.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>A Boost licensed preliminary implementation is available at
<a href="github.com/beman/unicode">github.com/beman/unicode</a>.</p>



<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>



<p>Jeffrey Yasskin, Titus Winters, Michael Spenser, and Fabio participated in a 
small group discussion of P0353R0 in Oulu. Lots of direction and specific 
comments that came out of the discussion are reflected in P0353R1. For example, 
removal of the requirement that <code>wchar_t</code> be UTF encoded and need to 
be more explicit about narrow encoding.</p>



<p>Tom Honermann provided insights about environments no based on POSIX or 
Windows, such as IBM&#39;s z/OS.</p>



<p>Alisdair Meredith, Eric Niebler, Howard Hinnant, Jeffrey Yasskin, 
Marshall Clow, PJ Plauger, and Stephan T. Lavavej participated in the Portland 
discussion of N3398. Many of the design decisions that have gone into the current 
proposal flow directly from the Portland discussion.</p>



<p>After the Portland meeting, Matt Austern sat down with Google&#39;s &quot;Unicode 
people&quot; to &quot;clarify things&quot;. His summary of that discussion was very helpful. 
Its guidance on error handling is  reflected in current  
proposal.</p>



<h2>Design decisions</h2>



<p><b>Limit this proposal to encoding conversion and other encoding-related functionality</b></p>



  <ul>
    <li>Getting UTF encoding conversion right is hard enough without also coping 
    with other Unicode needs.</li>
    <li>No all-encompassing Unicode proposal is on the horizon.</li>
    <li>Other needs requested by domain experts, such as code point iterators, 
    are important enough to deserve their own proposals.</li>
    <li>Guidance from both the committee and domain experts clearly favors a 
    proposal focusing on UTF conversions.</li>
  </ul>



<p><b>Build in support for UTF-8, UTF16, UTF-32 and wide (i.e. <code>wchar_t</code>) 
encodings</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The UTF encodings are a critical need for the standard to become Unicode 
  friendlier.</li>
  <li>Support for the implementation defined wide character encoding ensures 
  support for much existing code. </li>
</ul>



<p><b>Build in support for existing narrow to/from wide codecvt facets</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Allows this brand-new library to immediately support non-UTF encodings 
  without having to repeat two decades of codecvt facet development.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Provide two levels of functionality</b></p>
<blockquote>



<p>The <code>recode</code> function provides a recoding conversion 
algorithm. It operates on an input sequence and produces an output sequence, so 
provides STL-like functionality to meet generic needs.</p>



<p>The <code>to_string</code> function templates provide convenient encoding 
conversion for <code>string_view</code>, <code>u16string_view</code>, <code>
u32string_view</code>, and <code>wstring_view</code> arguments, and are intended 
to complement the existing standard library <code>to_string</code> family of 
functions.</p>



</blockquote>



<p><b>Provide a coherent error detection and handling policy</b></p>



<ul>
  <li>Follow the Unicode standard&#39;s requirement that &quot;A conformant encoding form 
  conversion will treat any ill-formed code unit
  sequence as an error condition.&quot; (Unicode 3.9 D93 and C10).</li>
  <li>Provide a note to inform users of as to when they do and do not have to 
  explicitly check for errors themselves.</li>
  <li>Provide error checking functions so that users can also explicitly check for errors 
  to meet application needs.</li>
  <li>Handle errors via function objects to support the varied user needs 
  described by domain experts.</li>
  <li>Default error handler function object follows the Unicode standard&#39;s 
  recommendation of U+FFFD as a replacement character. Their rationale is that 
  the other common approaches, including throwing an exception, can be and have 
  been used as attack vectors.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Provide encoding conversions as explicitly called non-member functions</b></p>



<ul>
  <li>Avoids possibly expensive hidden automatic encoding conversions in 
  unexpected places.</li>
  <li>Avoids the need to change existing standard library components.</li>
  <li>Builds on the other STL algorithms and the <code>to_string</code> functions already in the 
  standard library.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Place the proposed components in namespace <code>unicode</code></b></p>



<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Emphasizes that these functions assume <code>
  char</code> strings use a Unicode encoding.</li>
  <li>Signals that the committee cares about Unicode, but doesn&#39;t want to force 
  it on users who prefer other encodings.</li>
  <li>Provides a home for these and future Unicode specific functions.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Keep interfaces neutral as to which character type or UTF encoding is 
&quot;best&quot;</b></p>



<ul>
  <li>



<p>Each of these encodings have uses where it is preferred or required, and all 
of these needs may appear in the same application. For example:</p>



  <ul>
    <li>UTF-8 is required by the API&#39;s for some operating systems.</li>
    <li>UTF-16 is required to interfacing with existing databases that use UTF-16 
    encoding.</li>
    <li>UTF-32 is preferred in code where every 
    Unicode code point being encoded as a single code unit is advantageous.</li>
  </ul>



  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Provide types <code>narrow</code>, <code>utf8</code>, <code>
utf16</code>, <code>utf32</code>, and <code>wide</code> to identify encodings</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>String <code>value_type</code> alone is insufficient because in 
  the case of <code>char</code> it is ambiguous.</li>
  <li>
  <p>The resulting user code more explicit and so easier to read. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Base conformance and definitions on ISO/IEC 10646:2014</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewriting specifications that are already covered by another standard, 
  and then trying to keep that wording in sync as the other standard evolves, is 
  a path 
  to insanity.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Use variadic templates to minimize interface surface area</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Converting between each two pairs of five encodings (narrow, UTF-8, 
  UTF-16, UTF-32, wide) results in twenty-five possible conversion functions. 
  Providing conversion in both algorithm form and convenience function form 
  doubles the number of functions to fifty. Initially, use of templates reduced the 
  number of functions quite a bit, but trial use of an implementation for real 
  work was discouraging; it was too easy to get the arguments right but then 
  call the wrong function name.</li>
  <li>Use of variadic templates (i.e. a generative approach) reduced the 
  interface to two functions - one <code>recode</code> conversion algorithm and one <code>to_string</code> 
  convenience function. These closely match the abstraction and mental model of 
  their behavior; the differing arguments are just a detail. Static asserts can 
  ensure comprehensible error messages when contradictory argument types are 
  passed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use case (which would also make a good example): when recoding &quot;Kr<font face="Arial">ü</font>gler&quot; to 
  ASCII, output &quot;Kruegler&quot;. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C">
  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ü</a>. Approach: Loop over find_first_ill_formed(). 
  Approach rejected as overly complicated: Revise error handling to (1) add 
  arguments specifying range of ill-formed input, (2) return a 
  basic_string&lt;ToCharT&gt;. The concern has more to do with added implementation 
  complexity than interface complexity, so consider if imp could call (in an 
  inline detail function) first_ill_formed() to get the ill-formed range. Would 
  require ForwardIterators, which is probably OK. </li>
  <li>Add an optional codecvt argument to first_ill_formed() so it can also be 
  applied to narrow strings.</li>
  <li><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Specify handling of an initial
  </span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">BOM</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">. 
  Or is it the user&#39;s job to remove a leading BOM?</span></li>
  <li><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Specify handling of an embedded
  </span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">BOM</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Unicode library [ucs]</h2>

<p>This sub-clause describes components that C++ programs may use to perform 
operations on characters, strings, and other sequences of characters encoded in 
various encoding forms. Encoding forms UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are supported, as are  narrow 
character encodings having a <code>codecvt</code> facet meeting requirements 
described below.</p>

<p>[<i>Note:</i> The C++ standard does not require  the encoding of <code>
char</code>, <code>
char16_t</code>, <code>
char32_t,</code> and <code>wchar_t</code> strings be UTF encoded, although <code>
u8</code>, <code>u</code>, and <code>U</code> string literals are UTF encoded. The components in this sub-clause use the 
provided types <code>narrow</code>, <code>utf8</code>, <code>utf16</code>, <code>utf32</code>, and 
<code>wide</code> to identify specific 
encodings [uni.encoding]. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</p>

<h4>Error handling [uni.err]</h4>



<p>When an ill-formed code unit subsequence is detected during execution of a 
conversion function, an <i>error handler</i> function object shall be invoked. Unless 
the error handler throws an exception, the string returned by the error handler 
shall be added to the output sequence and the ill-formed input code unit subsequence 
shall not be converted and added to the output sequence. Detection and error 
handling for ill-formed code unit 
subsequences is required even when the input and output encodings are the same. 
[<i>Note:</i> If the error handler function object always returns a 
pointer to a well-formed code point sequence, the conversion function&#39;s entire 
output sequence will be a well-formed code point sequence. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</p>

<pre>template &lt;class CharT&gt; struct ufffd;
template &lt;&gt; struct ufffd&lt;char&gt;;
template &lt;&gt; struct ufffd&lt;char16_t&gt;;
template &lt;&gt; struct ufffd&lt;char32_t&gt;;
template &lt;&gt; struct ufffd&lt;wchar_t&gt;;</pre>


<p><code>struct ufffd</code> is the default error handler function object for conversion functions. 
The default error 
handling function object returns U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as a single code point error marker. Each specialization shall provide a member function with the signature:</p>

<blockquote>


<p> <code>constexpr const CharT* operator()() const noexcept;</code></p>

</blockquote>


<p>that returns a pointer to the value indicated in the Specializations table: </p>

</table>
</blockquote>

  <p>[<i>Note:</i> U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned as the default 
  single code point error marker in accordance with the recommendations of the Unicode Standard. 
  The rationale given by the Unicode standard is essentially that other commonly used approaches, including 
  throwing exceptions, can be and have been used as security attack vectors.
